# The Harmony Project #

Harmony is the next generation tool to reverse-engineer the information contained in the software version control systems. It is an extensible framework allowing you to gather the information you need to perform advanced studies against the history of software projects.

# User Manual #

If you want to try Harmony in 2 minutes, analyze your repositories or develop easily your own analysis the [User Manual](http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdoc.harmony.googlecode.com%2Fhg%2FHarmonyUserManual.pdf) is what you need.

In addition to the User Manual, several screencasts are available to guide you :
  * Harmony installation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGXayQADeA
  * Creation of a simple analysis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQCeLmu2WDg
